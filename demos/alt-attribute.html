<title>Alt Attribute Redundancy</title>

<introduction>
  <p>
    Adding alt attributes is important, but saying "image of a [fill in the
    blank]" is redundant.

        This is read as <i>"image image of a cat"</i> in a screen reader.

      <p>
        This is read as <i>"image cat"</i>. The screen reader already knows its
        an image, and says so by default. Screen reader users tend not to care
        about the "of a" because its already implied; keep what is read as brief
        as possible.
