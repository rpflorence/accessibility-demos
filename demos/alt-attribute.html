<title>Alt Attribute Redundancy</title>

<introduction>
  <p>
    Adding alt attributes is important, but saying "image of a [fill in the
    blank]" is redundant.

        This is read as "image image of a cat" in a screen reader
        (or "image of a cat, image").

      <p>
        This is read as "image cat" (or "cat, image"). The screen reader
        already knows its an image, and says so by default. Screen
        reader users tend not to care about the "of a" because its
        already implied; keep what is read as brief as possible.
