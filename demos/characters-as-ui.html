<title>Characters as UI</title>

<intro>
  <p>
    Sometimes we like to use characters, like "x" or the often better
    looking multiplication character, ×. These are confusing to screen
    reader users.

      This is read as <i>"times button"</i> in a screen reader. Are we
      doing math?

      This is read as <i>"close download chrome popup button"</i>. The button is not
      always read in the same context as it is visually displayed, so use a
      descriptive, but brief, label.
