<title>Characters as UI</title>

<introduction>
  <p>
    Sometimes we like to use characters, like "x" or the often better
    looking multiplication character, ×. These are confusing to screen
    reader users because they make no sense when read.

        This is read as <i>"times button"</i> in a screen reader. Are we
        doing math?

        This is read as <i>"close download chrome popup button"</i>. The button is not
        always read in the same context as it is visually displayed, so use a
        descriptive, but brief, label.
